* As a curious web surfer, I want to be able to locate both me and any website on a map.
* I sometimes use a desktop, sometimes a tablet and sometimes a cell phone, so I need a responsive web page.

### Business Narrative / Scenario ###
* GeoLocation is a working web application which aims to retrieve details about the user's location. 
* You need to augment GeoLocation with a new form that will allow the user to find out the physical location of websites, by displaying its hosting position on a map. 
* This new form will consist of a text field for the user to input the website domain.  It will also need a "Locate" button.
* It's required that GeoLocation is kept as a **Single page application (SPA)**.
* This SPA will require three routes or sections:
    * Home page with input box for the domain and a map which pinpoints the domain's location.
    * History of located websites. (Each time a user locates a website, it should be stored locally.)
    * Detail of a website from the history list (as shown in home page without an input box).
* You have to keep the current features working.
